# UC Davis Econometrics Project

The following is a paper written as a final project for my Economics 140 class in Spring 2022. 

### Prompt
Using a real world dataset with at least 250 cross sectional data units, create a question focusing on the relationship between one variable X and another variable Y and attempt to answer your question using OLS regressions, with single and multiple regressors, and a logit or probit regression. Include at least one scatter plot with a simple regression line and at least one self-contained table about the multiple regression. Your introduction should cite more than 5 references and your dataset should be described well.

### Tools:
The software Stata was used for cleaning and transforming the data as well as performing regressions and creating graphs.

### Data:
The dataset used in this project is [World Sustainability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/truecue/worldsustainabilitydataset) available to the public on Kaggle

### Project Grade: 99/100
